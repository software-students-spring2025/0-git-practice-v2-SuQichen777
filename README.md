##  An interesting article related to software engineering
[The hardest part of building software is not coding, it's requirements][1]

##  Why I chose this article
This article talked about the AI crisis that many software engiiners are worried about. The writer thinks that AI might be good at writing code, but it is not good at understanding and designing the requirements. The writer also mentioned that the requirements are the hardest part of building software and incremental development is a better way for humans to build software since it is more flexible and can adapt to the changes in requirements.
